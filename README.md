<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Dinner & Movie][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/hsafiya/dinner_n_movie/blob/README/assets/img/dinner_n_movie_.png)

* Description: 
Whether it is love, business or just "a thing" Dinner_n_Movie has you covered with incredible themed dinner ideas offers you  the perfect excuse to spend even more time at home. Not done social distancing? Allow Dinner_n_Movie the chance to provide something tasty to eat and fun to watch. Enjoy the large collection recipes carefully crafted to compliment the many movie offerings any fan will appreciate. Enjoy themed meals from around the world in the company of friends or loved ones. 

* Motivation for development: 
Dinner-n-Movie is an app intended to make date night easier. Check in to find great recipes for your favorite dishes. And grab movie suggestions for you next “Netflix and chill” session.

* User story: 
As a user I would like to to find simple recipes and movie suggestions for a date night.  When I make a selection for one option, I am given a choice if I want the other option. I want easy to make recipes and well known movies to watch.  I am also given either option (movie or recipe) at random if I don’t make specific choices.


### Built With

The project is an example of how you can build anything with Vanilla JavaScript with very little assistance from major frameworks.  We attempted to use only what was necessary to build a responsive project.
